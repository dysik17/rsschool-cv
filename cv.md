### Summary

Hello everyone, my name is Daria, but you can call me your future employees.

My goal is to become a highly qualified specialist in the development of websites, applications and games.

I am from the small city of Kostroma, located in the Center of Russia.

Now I live and study in the city of St. Petersburg, at the Faculty of "Digital and Industrial Technologies".

I used to love dancing. I have devoted 8 years of my life to dancing, which I am very happy about. I also worked in a modeling studio for more than 5 years.

I have no experience in web development.

Now, in my free time, I like to read books, spend time with friends and travel. I am also looking for a job in web development that I can combine with my university studies.
